# Contributing Modules

Contributions are more than welcome!

Eruptr is a 100% Open Source project currently released under the GPL v3.0. It
will always be available under an Open Source licence.

1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a 
feature idea or a bug or simply just create a pull request for your new module!
2. Fork the repository on GitHub to start making your changes to the main branch 
(or branch off of it).
3. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as 
expected. Note that you can skip this part for now. As a young project we are
yet to establish a testing framework here - this will be available soon.
4. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. 
When you submit your pull request please add the following information to the text 
of your request:

    ```

The licence agreement specified above does not impact the Open Source nature of
your contribution under the GPL 3.0. It provides a statement of indemnity for us
with respect to your contribution and any third parties and allows us to use 
your contribution as part of any derivative commercial works.
